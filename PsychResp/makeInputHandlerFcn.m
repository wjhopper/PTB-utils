        % 1: If the "Enter" of "Return" key is hit, then length of the response string
        %   is checked. If the response string is not empty, set the advance flag
        %   to 1.
        % 2: If the right arrow key is pressed, then length of the response string
        %   is checked. If the response string is empty, set the advance flag
        %   to 1.
        % 3: If the backspace key is pressed, then length of the response string
        %   is checked. If the response string is not empty, then set remove
        %   the final character from the string, and remove the last recorded
        %   RT. The value of the redraw flag is set to -1.
        % 4: If any other key is pressed, then that keys character value is
        %   concatenated to the existing response string, and the recorded time
        %   for that key presses is concatenated to the existing rt vector
        %   is checked. The value of redraw flag is set to 1.

        % given by the participant) as well as the advance and redraw flags.

    % This function is a wrapper around kbQueueaHandler, which provides
    % automatic keyboard input by simulating a keypress of each character in the given response string
    % with Java Robot object instead of waiting for a human.
    %
    % The tricky bit here is that it doesn't loop over each character in the string,
    % Instead, this function is a closure and we share a stateful indexing variable n
    % with the parent function, makeInputHandlerFcn. n starts off set to 1 in the
    % parent function. If n is less than or equal to  the length of the answer,
    % we construct the robot press and release calls for that character, hand off
    % to the actual input handler function to record it, and increment the indexing
    % variable n (e.g. n = n + 1 =2). This increment is remembered the next
    % time we enter the function, because this function is a closure.
    %
    % When n grows larger than the length of the answer string, we press
    % and release the Enter key to confirm the previously recorded input
    % and advance. Before returning, n is reset to 1, and this reset is
    % remembered the next time we enter this function (which should be for
    % a new answer to input) and so we begin with inputing the first character of
    % the new answer.
